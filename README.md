## Supported entities

Supported configuration in imports and exports are documented on this project's [wiki](https://github.com/nicolonsky/ModernWorkplaceConcierge/wiki/Entities-supported-in-exports-and-imports).

## Consent and Permissions

To Authenticate with the Microsoft Graph API a multi tenant Azure AD application performs authentication and you will need to provide admin consent to the Azure AD application before you can use this tool.

## Privacy

The app uses Azure application insights and traces performance markers [what-does-application-insights-monitor](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/app/app-insights-overview#what-does-application-insights-monitor). All data is processed in memory and not stored persistent or used for further processing.

### Host your own instance

If you are not allowed to or don't like to use the public instance of the Modern Workplace Concierge you can deploy an instance in your Azure tenant & setup an app registration.
